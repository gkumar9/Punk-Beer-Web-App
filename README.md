# Punk-Beer-Web-App
Use the punk beer API to create a unique project that uses templating to show data on the page.

# Technologies Used
 - Vue.js
 - Bluma CSS framework
 - Punk API

# Following task are achieved
 - Showing data on the page from a generic API request
 - A search bar, which makes a separate query to a database on request (used respective query parameters provided by punk API documentation)
 - Added favourite functionality which allows you to favourite a card
 - Created a separate route (using vue-route) which allows you to see all the beers youâ€™ve favourited in the session. Also, here session is until you refresh the page all the favourite are displayed. At page refresh they are removed. For saving I used Vuex.
 - Added a infinite scrolling pagination in index page(search page)
